## Week 1

The theme for my dataset will be **Scottish & Irish _(Contemporary?)_ Folk Music**.

There will be a focus on artists and groups who have a relative degree of fame, such as _The Pogues_ and _Runrig_, as it will be possible to provide both audio recordings _and_ musical scores to this dataset.

For example, a quick search for _The Pogues_ provides a table of metadata for all of their music releases on _Discogs_, a good amount of sheet music samples of their songs appear on _musescore_, and their entire catalogue of music is available on youtube and all digital streaming platforms such as _Spotify_.
