The theme for my dataset will be **Tudor Church Music**.

Musical scores, metadata and audio recordings for religious music are all widely available online and in physical form.
Many of them are in the public domain, although more recent arrangements may be subject to copyright protection.
Musical scores are available online from sites such as musescore (free) or from individual churches and organisations (pay/subscribe).
Audio recordings are available on streaming platforms, youtube, and in physical CDs.
Metadata often is curated alongside both musical scores and audio recordings.
